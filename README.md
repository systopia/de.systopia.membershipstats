# CiviCRM Membership Statistics Extension

This extension creates a small custom field set with each contact that reflects
its current membership status. This allows you to access this information more
easily, e.g. in reporting.

Upon activation, the status for each contact will be calculated. This might take
a while, but is necessary. Later, this information is updated each time a change
to the membership entry is performed.

This should keep the statistics always up to date, but in case it is out of
sync, simply disable and enable the extension to do a complete refresh. Please
also create an issue or simply drop us an email, so we can find out what went
wrong.
